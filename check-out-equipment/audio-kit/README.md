# Audio Kit

## Overview

#### [**Zoom M4 Manual**](https://zoomcorp.com/media/documents/E\_M4\_3.pdf)

The Zoom M4 has two onboard mics for high quality stereo sound. In addition those, the M4 also has two XLR/1/4" jack inputs that can be used with a variety of other external microphones or instruments. The M4 records in 32 bit float format which avoids clipping meaning there is no need to set gain. This versatile piece of equipment normally acts as an audio recorder, but it can also be used as an audio interface, allowing you to record directly onto your computer using whatever software you like, such as Ableton Live, Adobe Audtion, Reaper, Etc. If you want a more extensive overview, watch this short video:&#x20;
