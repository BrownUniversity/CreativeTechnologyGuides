## Accessories

#### Joby GorrilaPod

The GorrilaPod works as a table-top tripod, letting you set up the GoPro for static shots. It is best used for time lapses, live-performance videos, or any other shots where the camera doesn't need to move. Use the ball head at the top of the tripod to adjust the angle of the camera.

#### Head Mount

The head mount allows you to capture point-of-view footage for action sports, vlogging, or anything else you can think of. Just use the adjustable straps to fit the GoPro to your head.

#### "The Handler" Floating Hand Grip

"The Handler" gives you a large grip to capture handheld footage with the GoPro. For instance, you can face it towards you for vlogging or away to capture point-of-view footage. The grip can also float in water if you want to capture any footage around water, although always make sure to use the wrist strap when using the hand grip around water!

#### Flexible Grip Mount

The flexible grip mount is a versatile mount that lets you attach the GoPro to a variety of irregularly shaped objects. As in the pictures here, you can attach it to poles or railings, but feel free to try it on any objects at your location. If it can wrap around the mounting point, it should be strong enough to hold the GoPro up!
