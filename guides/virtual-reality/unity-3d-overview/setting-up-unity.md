**Unity Hub** is a program that helps manage your licenses, projects and unity installations.

Go to [https://unity.com/download](https://unity.com/download) to download Unity Hub for your operating system.

## Install Unity

Once you have installed Unity Hub you will need to install a version of Unity. In Unity editor click on Installs on the right side of the window and then click the Install Editor button in the upper right corner.

Unity Projects are tightly connected to the version of Unity you create them with so it is best to using a LTS (**Long Term Service**) version of the application which is supported longer. You can install multiple versions of Unity at once for different projects.
