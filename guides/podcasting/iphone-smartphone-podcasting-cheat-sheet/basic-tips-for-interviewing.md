# üó£ Basic tips for interviewing

**BEFORE THE INTERVIEW**

* **Reserve a quiet space for the interview**
  * In order to get the best quality audio, your interview should happen in as silent a space as possible. Public spaces like cafes are generally bad, unless you are _purposefully_ trying to capture the effect of a conversation in a noisy cafe (a rare scenario). The best option is a recording studio, and the second best would be a private room.
  * When using a space that‚Äôs not a recording studio, it‚Äôs a good idea to go early and make sure there aren‚Äôt sounds like: people talking, music, buzzing or humming from air vents, refrigerators, etc.
  * Some good spaces on campus include:
    * The recording studio in the Rock (learn more about that space [here](https://library.brown.edu/create/digitalstudio/) and reserve it [here](https://tinyurl.com/dsbrown154))
    * Grad Center Studio (run by the MML; sign up for a training to get card access and/or reserve the studio [here](https://blogs.brown.edu/multimedialabs/grad-center-studio/))
    * Professors‚Äô offices (make sure you shut all doors and windows before starting)
    * If you‚Äôre just recording yourself or interviewing a friend, your own bedroom should also work. For extra good sound, build a blanket fort to record in! (soft materials absorb sound)
* **Make sure your phone has enough charge**
  * Using a voice recording app takes very little battery, but you should still make sure that your phone is going to stay alive for the whole interview.
  * In a pinch, you can plug your phone in and it _will_ still record audio while you‚Äôre charging. However, the recorder might pick up extra noise if the charging cable scrapes the table, so try to avoid this entirely by charging your phone beforehand.
* **Prepare a thorough list of questions**
  * Try to brainstorm _everything_ you might want to know, and put it all on a list. This can include specific questions or just broad themes/topics you want to cover.
  * Then bring the list with you, but try not to read from it during the interview. If you let the conversation flow more naturally, you‚Äôll often get more engaging material.
  * Pull out your questions again at the end to make sure you didn‚Äôt miss anything.
* **Put your phone on Do Not Disturb**
  * Put your phone on DO NOT DISTURB, and ask your interviewee to do the same. To do this, swipe up on your screen until the Control Center appears. Tap the small moon button, which will block your phone from receiving notifications while Do Not Disturb is in use.
  * \*NOTE: simply putting your phone on silent is not as good as using Do Not Disturb. Sometimes incoming calls will automatically pause your recorder, and even if you reject the call, the recorder will still be paused. This can cause you to miss critical parts of your interview if you forget to restart your recorder.

**DURING THE INTERVIEW**

* **Try not to make any sounds while the interviewee is talking**
  * This means don‚Äôt talk over them, but also try not to laugh or say little things like ‚Äúuhuh,‚Äù and ‚Äúokay.‚Äù Instead, show you‚Äôre listening by nodding or reacting with your face.
* **Try not to fidget**
  * Recording apps can capture even the smallest noises, like the clicking of a pen or the tapping of a foot. It‚Äôs best to sit in a non-swivel chair and remove all distractions from near you. This includes pens, jackets, and anything else that could create noise.

**AFTER THE INTERVIEW**

* **At the end of the interview ALWAYS record 30 seconds of silence in your interview space before you leave**
  * This audio, which is called ‚Äúroom tone,‚Äù will be incredibly helpful during the editing process. Sometimes, you‚Äôll need to add pauses in your piece, but leaving fully blank space sounds weird. So does adding in silence recorded at a different space and time ‚Äî subtle changes in background sound are noticeable.
  * I like to use this 30 seconds to ask my interviewee to reflect on whether there‚Äôs anything else they‚Äôd like to say, and I do the same.
