The most common way to make sure your camera is on is to check if the LCD panel is on:

* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">If the LCD panel is off, it could be due to:</mark>
  * the lens cap still being on the lens
  * "Live View" is set to off
  * as a back up, pressing the menu button should bring up the camera menu on the LCD panel, verifying that your camera is on.
* <mark style="background-color:red;">If your camera is</mark> <mark style="background-color:red;"></mark><mark style="background-color:red;">**not**</mark> <mark style="background-color:red;"></mark><mark style="background-color:red;">turning on:</mark>
  * Check that there is a battery in the battery compartment
  * If there is a battery, it may not be charged

### SD Cards&#x20;

The SD Card slot, with the camera lens facing away from you, can be found on the right hand side.&#x20;

This camera features dual SD slots and has been set to record to both SD cards for this purpose we will decide that:

* SD Card Slot 1 (top) is for _**Student**_ SD Cards
* SD Card Slot 2 (bottom) is for the _**Instructor's**_ SD Card
*

This will allow each student to have their own recording of their performance while also providing the instructor with recordings of all the students performances

To remove an SD card, gently press the SD card into the slot and it will release, allowing you to remove it.

To insert an SD card, gently press the SD card fully into the slot until it clicks into place.
