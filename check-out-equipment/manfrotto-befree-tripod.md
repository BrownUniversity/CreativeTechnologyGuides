# Manfrotto Befree Tripod

### Setting up the Tripod

When you initially take the tripod out of its carrying case, it will be folded up for travel. The first step in setting up the tripod is to pull down the three legs. As you pull down each leg, you should hear three clicks, which means that the legs are in place.&#x20;

The next step is to adjust the tripod to the desired height. Each of the three tripod legs has three expandable sections that can easily be adjusted with the levers near the feet of the tripod. To raise the legs, just flip out the levers, raise the tripod, and push the levers back down to lock the tripod at the desired height. When adjusting the legs, make sure that all three legs are expanded equally so the tripod stays level and upright. Additionally, the center column can also be raised or lowered by twisting the knob at its base. Just twist the center knob counterclockwise to unlock and clockwise to lock it back at the desired height.

The last step before putting the camera on the tripod is to ensure that the tripod head is level. To check whether the head is level, there is a handy bubble level on the tripod head. If the head is not already level, you can use the knob at the base of the head to adjust its positioning. As previously, you twist the knob counterclockwise to loosen and clockwise to tighten once the bubble level indicates that the head is level.&#x20;

### Attaching and Positioning the Camera

Before you can put the camera on the tripod, you need to ensure that the tripod plate is securely attached to the camera. If the plate is not already attached or needs to be tightened, use a screwdriver or coin to secure the screw into the hole on the bottom of the camera. Tighten the plate until you cannot wiggle it with your hands.

Now you are ready to put the camera on the tripod! To do so, just slide the plate onto the head of the tripod with the lens facing away from the tripod handle. If the plate does not slide on, try loosening the knob on the left side by twisting it counterclockwise to loosen. Once the camera is in position, twist the knob clockwise to secure the camera to the tripod.&#x20;

Now that the camera is on the tripod, you can frame up your shot. Tripods give you two axes on which to change the camera angle: horizontally (pan) and vertically (tilt). Loosening the pan knob allows you to turn the camera horizontally, left and right. Loosening the tilt knob allows you to turn the camera vertically, up and down.  As well, if you loosen the knob attached to the tripod arm, you can move the arm out to give you better control over the pan and tilt. Once you have the shot framed to your liking, tighten down the pan and tilt knobs so that the camera will stay where it is.

### Packing the Tripod Up

1. Remove the camera from the tripod. Loosen the knob that tightens the plate, then slide the camera back out. There is also a safety release button next to the knob that you must hold down while sliding out the camera.
2. Extend the center column to its full height.&#x20;
3. Move the tripod arm down to be in line with the rest of the tripod.
4. Fully retract the tripod legs.
5. Flip the legs back up. To do so, slide down the silver tab at the top of each leg. To unlock the silver tab, you may need to first press the legs down, towards the center, before pulling them back towards the top.
6. Put it back in its bag! You've successfully used the Manfrotto Befree Tripod!
