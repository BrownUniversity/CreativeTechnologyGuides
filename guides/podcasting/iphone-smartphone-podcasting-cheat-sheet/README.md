# ðŸ“± iPhone/Smartphone Podcasting Cheat Sheet

Using Your iPhone/Smartphone for Podcasting

### This guide will teach you how to record sound with common apps found on your iPhone or smartphone, and it will also give you some tips on the basics of interviewing for a podcast. <a href="#_9armsux2jkzt" id="_9armsux2jkzt"></a>

### **\*NOTE:** This cheatsheet is geared towards the usage of the Voice Memos application on an Apple iPhone. For Android users, we recommend the use of [Smart Voice Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrwq.recorder\&hl=en\_US), a free, extremely user-friendly app. The directions for using Smart Voice Recorder are nearly identical to the use of Voice Memos on iPhones, so this cheatsheet should still give you a good understanding of how to use your smartphone to conduct an interview. <a href="#_tsxfdwvnfhxf" id="_tsxfdwvnfhxf"></a>
