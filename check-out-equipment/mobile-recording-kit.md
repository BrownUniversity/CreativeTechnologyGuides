# Mobile Recording Kit

In the past decade, the cameras in smartphones have been getting better and better to the point where now, if used properly, phone footage can be almost indistinguishable from larger mirrorless cameras or DSLRs. Of course, phones don't do everything perfectly, so the mobile kit includes a few key accessories to significantly improve your phone's video capabilities.

The first step in setting up the mobile kit is to set up the handgrip/tripod. The handgrip/tripod is multi-functional with two main configurations, so pick whichever option works best for your shot.

#### Option 1: Tripod

The tripod configuration is best for making stationary videos, especially of yourself when you don't have someone else to hold the phone. The tripod works best when you have a table, chair, or other elevated surface to place it on.  To turn the handgrip into a tripod, simply flip the two outmost legs out. Be aware that they may stick some as they flip out.

Next, to be able to attach your phone to the tripod, just screw on the included phone adapter. To attach your phone, hold down the red button while extending the adapter. Then, place your phone in and contract the unit while holding down the red button, until the phone is securely held by the adapter.

The tripod has a few options that let you adjust how the phone is positioned. To level, pan, and tilt, there is a ball head at the top of the tripod. Additionally, loosening screws (but not fully removing them!) lets allows you to raise the tripod. When raising the tripod, try to keep the phone above the center of the tripod, so it stays balanced.

Remember to fold the tripod back up and pack in the carrying case when done.

#### Option 2: Vlog Stick

The vlog stick or handgrip configuration is best for shooting handheld video, especially of yourself.

As above...

Next, to be able to attach your phone to the tripod, just screw on the included phone adapter. To attach your phone, hold down the red button while extending the adapter. Then, place your phone in and contract the unit while holding down the red button, until the phone is securely held by the adapter.

If you want, the handgrip can also be extended with the screws. Adjusting it, same as above.

Feel free to play around with the handgrip, as it's design allows it to be configured into other grip options as well.
