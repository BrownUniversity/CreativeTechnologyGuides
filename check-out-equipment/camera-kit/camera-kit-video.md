The most common way to make sure your camera is on is to check if the LCD panel is on:

* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">If the LCD panel is off, it could be due to:</mark>
  * the lens cap still being on the lens
  * "Live View" is set to off
  * as a back up, pressing the menu button should bring up the camera menu on the LCD panel, verifying that your camera is on.
* <mark style="background-color:red;">If your camera is</mark> <mark style="background-color:red;"></mark><mark style="background-color:red;">**not**</mark> <mark style="background-color:red;"></mark><mark style="background-color:red;">turning on:</mark>
  * Check that there is a battery in the battery compartment
  * If there is a battery, it may not be charged
