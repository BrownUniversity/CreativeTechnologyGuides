# ðŸŽ› 3 Person Podcasting / Using the Tracking Room

#### The Tracking Room  is a great resource to record in a more 'ideal' setting. Let's go over how to use it.

It's recommended to have a recording assistant present when recording in the tracking room. There currently is no way of interacting with the control room computer from inside, so an assistant can help with setting the levels and recording on queue for the podcasters.&#x20;

Getting Started with a 3 person tracking room set-up:

Similar to **Step 2** of the Beginner Guide, we will need microphones (_from the grey corner cabinet_) and mic stands. In addition to the AKG C414 mics, the \[insert here] is a good option for a third mic. \[insert] can usually be found on the left-side cabinet in the control room.&#x20;

Perform sub-steps 1-13 of **Step 2** for three microphones with the following notes:&#x20;

* With three mic stands, it's important to remember that they should be configured so that no participant is directed immediately at another, this is to prevent _feedback._
* _Step 11_ shows the XLR cables being plugged into the floor panel in the control room. We will instead be using a panel in the tracking room, specifically the \[insert]. This should route the signal to preamps numbered \[insert] that the recording assistant can turn on phantom power for.
* If there aren't any chairs in the tracking room, feel free to take some from the control room for your set up. Please put back all equipment using chairs when you're done.
* Although you cannot (currently) interact with the PC, it should be displayed on a screen inside the tracking room. You should be able to view your Ableton session as you record.

Lastly, the Recording Assistants and CTAs are here to help you! Please don't hesitate to reach out to them with any questions.
