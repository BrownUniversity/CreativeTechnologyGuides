# ðŸŽš STEP 4: Setting Level and Recording

1.  Time to do a practice recording! Let's start by turning off the monitors (speakers) so that the sound is only coming through the headphones. Click the 'C' box at the bottom right to toggle between speakers on/off.

2.  Adjust headphone volume through the **hearback** mixer. Please note that this level might need to be changed again after step 5.

3.  Press the circle at the top of Ableton to start a recording and start talking into the microphones.

4.  Your voices should be prominent and clear but not too loud or too quiet. Here's what the audio files should look like:

5.  On the **Preamp**, use the **Edit knob** to select and change the **dB** of tracks 5 & 6 until the output on Ableton seems reasonable.

6. Once you're happy with the Gain levels, press 'spacebar' to stop the practice recording. Click on the practice audio files and press 'delete' to remove them.&#x20;
7. Click the record circle at the top once again to start your podcast.

## Have fun!
