#### Control Room

Where the engineers and producers sit and take care of making sure good signals get recorded as well as controlling, in many cases, what the band hears during a performance.

#### Hertz (Hz)

The smallest, basic measure of frequency (1 Hz = 1 cycle per second). The frequency values determine the tonality and influence the timbre of the sounds.

#### High Pass Filter

A high-pass filter is an EQ curve that is used to remove low-frequency sounds from an audio signal. It is called a high-pass filter because it allows high-frequency signals to pass through, while attenuating (reducing the amplitude of) lower-frequency signals.

#### Phantom Power

DC electric power transmitted through microphone cables to operate microphones that contain active electronic circuitry. Phantom power is most commonly used with condenser mics because they use electrical circuitry to convert vibrations in the air into audio signals.

#### Polar Pattern

The space around a microphone where it picks up sound/is the most sensitive to sound. These patterns can be visualized in three-dimensional space. Different microphones have different polar patterns, and these patterns play a role in determining their best uses.

#### Tracking Room

The typically more absorbent room where instruments and vocals are recorded. For this set up we are using the Control Room as a tracking room because the walls are well insulated and non-reflective.
